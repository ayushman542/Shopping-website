            Long lines, parking difficulties, crowded spaces, time-consuming,
            everyone knows the hassles of doing groceries at the store. These
            are therefore the top reasons for customers to do online grocery
            shopping (Reitsma, 2010). France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom
            and the United State are the biggest online grocery markets, with
            full range online retailers (Warschun, et al., 2012). The U.K. is
            the most developed market, with around 20% of the households doing
            online grocery shopping (IGD, 2013). Amazon is the leading company
            on the e-grocery market (Rudarakanchana, 2014). With the launch of
            AmazonFresh in San Francisco it is extending its online grocery
            shopping branch (Somerville, 2013), but encounters serious
            competition from established grocery stores like Wal-Mart in the
            U.S. and Tesco in the U.K. (Moskowitz, 2014).

            Online grocery shopping is not something that can be offered by
            every grocery store around the corner, it requires high investments
            and logistics infrastructures (Hays, Keskinocak, López, 2004). Many
            supermarkets do see the customer need for convenience and  therefore
            provide a more digital environment in store. Ranging from
            self-service check outs to smart shopping charts with real time
            feedback on promotions, recommended complementary products, sharing
            recipes and allowing to skip the checkout lane (van Ittersum, et al.
            2013, Menezes & Usmani, 2010). Although there is supply and demand
            for online grocery shopping, only 3,3% of global supermarkets
            sales of $ 60.000,- billion (FMI, 2012) is coming from
            e-grocery, expected 4% by the end of 2014 (Hamstra, 2013). Main
            reasons for the little use of online grocery shopping can be found
            in trust, costs and habits.

            Trust Especially for fresh products, customers  lack trust in
            employees’ choice and product quality without seeing it themselves
            (Galant, López & Monroe, 2013, pp 23). “Putting trust into the hands
            of robots and employees who aren't necessarily as observant isn't
            easy. While Amazon does let you choose between "ripe" and "not ripe"
            avocados, everything else is a gamble.” (Vaknin, 2013).  Cost Lower
            cost is one of the main reasons for customers to shop online. Due to
            the low margins on groceries, extra cost like; minimum amount of
            spending and delivery cost are charged for online grocery shopping.
            This has a negative influence on the customers’ decision to do
            online grocery shopping (Hays, Keskinocak, López, 2004).

            Habit Despite of the hassles experienced during grocery shopping in
            store, customers are used to this environment and it is part of
            their weekly routine and has become ritualised. Breaking with these
            habits, emotionally and physically, is something that takes time
            (Hartman Group, 2013).  “Most customers were not ready to change
            their shopping habits, and even if they were, they preferred to buy
            from existing stores selling online, which they found familiar and
            more reliable.” (Galant, López & Monroe, 2013, pp 31).
